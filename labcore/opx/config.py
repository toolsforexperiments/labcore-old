# FIXME: Docstring incomplete
class QMConfig:
    """
    Base class for a QMConfig class. The purpose of this class is to implement the real time changes of the
    parameter manager with the OPX. We do this to always have the most up-to-date parameters from the
    parameter manager and integration weights (which depend on the parameters in the parameter manager).

    By default, when a new config is generated this class will close any open QuantumMachines that are using the same
    controllers that this config uses. To not do this pass False to close_other_machines in config().

    The user should still manually write the config dictionary used for the specific physical setup that the
    measurement is going to be performed but a few helper methods are implemented in the base class: two helper
    methods to write integration weights and a method that creates and adds the integration weights to the config dict.

    If the constructor is overriden the new constructor should call the super constructor to pass the parameter manager
    instance used.

    If the constructor is overriden because the parameter manager is not being used, the method config(self) also needs
    to be overriden.

    To have the integration weights added automatically into the config dict, you have to implement config_(self).
    config_(self) should return the python dictionary without the integration weights in it.
    If this is the case, the already implemented config(self) method will add the integration weights when called and
    return the python dictionary with the integration weights added.

    The add_integration_weights will go through the items in the pulses dictionary and add weights to any
    pulse that has the following characteristics:
        * The key of the pulse starts with the str 'readout'. If the first 7 characters of the key are not 'readout'
          that pulse will be ignored.
        * It needs to have the string '_pulse', present in its key. anything that comes before '_pulse' is
          as the name of the pulse, anything afterwards gets ignored.
          e.g. If my pulse name is: 'readout_short_pulse', 'readout_short' is taken as a unique pulse that requires
          integration weights. If another pulse exists called: 'readout_short_pulse_something_else'
          add_integration_weights will add the same integration weights as it did to 'readout_short'.
          This is useful if you have 2 different pules of the same length that need the same integration weights.
        * For each unique pulse there needs to be a parameter in the parameter manager with the unique pulse name
          followed by len. This is where the length of the pulse will be taken to get the
          integration weights. An underscore ('_') in the pulse name will be interpreted as a dot ('.') in the
          parameter manager.
          e.g. If I have a pulse with name 'readout_short_pulse', the pulse name is 'readout_short' and there should
          be a parameter in the parameter manager called: 'readout.short.len' with the pulse length in it.
    Any pulse that does not fulfil any of the three requirements will be ignored and will not have
    integration weights.

    3 integration weights will be created for each unique pulse, a flat integration weights
    for a full demodulation, flat integration weights for a sliced demodulation and weighted integration weights.
    The weights for the weighted integration will be loaded from the calibration files folder.
    If no weights are found in the calibration folder for a pulse, flat ones will be used instead.
    If old integration weights are found in the file, they will be deleted.
