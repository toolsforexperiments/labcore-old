"""plottr.data.datadict_storage

Provides file-storage tools for the DataDict class.

Description of the HDF5 storage format
======================================

We use a simple mapping from DataDict to the HDF5 file. Within the file,
a single DataDict is stored in a (top-level) group of the file.
The data fields are datasets within that group.

Global meta data of the DataDict are attributes of the group; field meta data
are attributes of the dataset (incl., the `unit` and `axes` values). The meta
data keys are given exactly like in the DataDict, i.e., incl the double
underscore pre- and suffix.
